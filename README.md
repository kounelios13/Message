# Message
<h2>Tired of writing JOptionPane.showMessageDialog() or JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog()?</h2>
<p>Message is a class of <em>static</em> methods that help you you deal with that.

Let's say you want to display a warning dialog to the user.

You just type ```Message.warning('your message here')```.
Want the user to confirm something:<br>
```boolean answer = Message.confirm('message here')```.

For a complete list of methods read the  javadoc
